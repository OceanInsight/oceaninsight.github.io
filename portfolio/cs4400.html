          <p>
            The CS4400 Frequency Converter System was specifically designed for troposcatter communications between 4.4 GHz to 5 GHz.
            When combined with a Comtech CS-series troposcatter modem, the two transmit and four receive channels allow for both dual
            and quad diversity system configurations.
            The redundant architecture and highly modular design serve to increase reliability, and simplify any maintenance that may be
            required. The CS4400 is the natural complement to Comtech CS-series modems, and is currently utilized in modern troposcatter
            systems around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fixed troposcatter installations allow distant sites to maintain high data rate, low latency communications with a
            high level of availability. Capable of ranges upwards of 200 km, they can reduce the need for multiple line-of-sight
            repeater stations, eliminating additional infrastructure and manpower costs.

            Fixed troposcatter sites are especially useful in the commercial energy sector as they provide a solid communications
            link from a shore site to an offshore platform that would otherwise need to rely on satellite communications.
            Troposcatter installations allow the operator to own the spectrum space being used, avoiding the high recurring
            cost associated with leasing satellite bandwidth.
